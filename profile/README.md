# About

openinput is a project that provides firmware for input devices like mice, keyboards, etc. The main focus of the project is to provide a good end-user experience, from configuration drivers to firmware updates to overall reliability.

We hope to enable the community share and develop their creativity by allowing them to build and tinker with devices without having to worry about troublesome technical issues like software support, etc. openinput provides the underlying framework required to make all this possible.

Please head over to the [documentation](https://openinput.readthedocs.io/en/latest) for instructions, guidelines and information.
